         <p id="testp" class="funParagraph">&#182; So you want to brew some beer, but you don't know where to start. 
            Well the first thing you will need to do is gather your ingredients. 
            Beer consists of four main ingredients; water, malt, hops, and yeast. 
            There are some other ingredients that can be used as well, unless you 
            are following the Reinheitsgebot, but these first four are a must. </p>
         <section>
            <h2>
               Water
               <link href="water">
            </h2>
            <img class="picLeft" id='water' src="html-me-something\water.JPG" alt="image of water in container">
            <p>&#182; Where to find these ingredients. Let's start with water, if you are fortunate 
               like me you have running water right in your home, so we can check that off… Well no. 
               If you are also fortunate like me you have a great municipal water that drinks well 
               right out of the tap, well balanced pH and without heavy mineral deposits. Why is this 
               important? Depending on the type of beer you want to make, the type of taste that you 
               want to achieve, and whether or not you want to be able to duplicate that beer at a 
               later date water chemistry will play an important role. 
               
               We won’t go too far into the weeds on water chemistry today, 
               but it is important to know what water chemistry does for your beer. 
               Different regional beer styles developed based on the water that was available to 
               the brewers at the time. A common example is the baltic porter, this style came about 
               when brewers in the baltic began brewing english style porters. The water profile of 
               the baltics favoured malty full bodied beer. So when brewers in the US try to emulate 
               this style, it is important to know the role of water chemistry. This can be important 
               in your home brewing as well. If you brew your winning beer that all of your family 
               loves in say Virginia, it will be difficult to duplicate that if you move to Arizona, 
               where the water is very different. But if you know your water chemistry then it may be 
               possible to duplicate with any source of water. </p>

            <h2>
               Malts
            </h2>
            <link href="malt">
            <img class="picRight" id='grains' src="html-me-something\handsinmalt.jpg" alt="hands in malt">
            <p>&#182; Malts  are the backbone of beer. And when you hear people talk about malts, they are 
               talking about malted barley. You will likely hear these words interchanged as you listen 
               to different people discuss the beer making process. What is barley? Well barley is a 
               member of the grass family, it is a key cereal crop, and you may be more familiar with 
               some of its cousins, such as wheat and corn. Very similar in appearance to wheat in my 
               opinion barley grows like grass and then produces seeds. These seeds (or grains) are 
               what are used primarily to make beer. 

               &#182; The barley seed is full of starches and proteins that are perfect to make beer. They 
               just need to be treated a certain way to get them there. You see to make beer we want 
               the starches in these grains to be broken down to sugar and to make that process easier, 
               we allow the seed to start the work for us, to do so we begin the malting process. 
               The grains are soaked in water and then spread on a malt house floor by a maltster. 
               This causes the seed to begin to sprout  and produce enzymes that will help break 
               starch down into sugar, it is at this point the maltster will collect the seeds then 
               place in a heating kinel and dry out the seeds stopping the sprouting process (if not 
               the seed will grow and use up all those precious starches). Now we have malted barley. 
               Kineling temperatures, times, and regions where the barley was grown can all have an 
               impact on the final product. And at your first trip to a home brew store you will see 
               that there are many different varieties to choose from. I’ll talk about some of those 
               later, but the majority of the malted barley you will use will likely be some variety of 
               Pilsner Malt or Pale Malt. </p>

            <h2>
               Hops
            </h2>
            <link href="hops">

            <p>&#182; Now we know where malt comes from let's look at our next ingredient, hops. Hops are essential 
               to beer. The first reason hops are needed for beer is their bittering quality, without this 
               beer would be too sweet. The second reason is that hops act as a natural preservative. 
               The third is their flavor, hops are full of flavor and dozens if not hundreds of varieties in 
               the world today, and more are being cultivated as we speak. Hops are from the humulus lupulus 
               plant, a member of the hemp family. These plants grow on a vine much like a grape. After 
               harvesting, hops are sent to breweries and home brewers and one of two ways; whole flowers 
               or crushed pellets. The pellet form is the most commonly used. </p>

            <h2>
               Yeast
            </h2>
            <link href="yeast">
            <img class="picRight" id='yeastStarter' src="html-me-something\yeastinsolution.jpg" alt="Yeast starter in liquid form, inside of a graduated beaker">
            <p>&#182; The final ingredient to beer is yeast. This single celled fungus converts sugar into alcohol 
               and creates flavor compounds. Feeding the yeast digestible sugars so that it can create alcohol
                is the primary purpose of the barley when it comes to making beer. For a long time, humankind 
                did not know what caused beer to ferment, but around the 18th century yeast was discovered 
                and a revolution in cultivating, isolating, and developing new strains began. 

                &#182; Yeast nowadays comes from yeast producing laboratories, though some brewers elect to have open
                fermentation allowing wild yeast and bacteria from the air to ferment their beer, just like in
                 the days of old (this produces wild beer, typically sour). 
               
               
                 &#182; So now that we’ve discussed the background of the ingredients, next time we will figure out what 
               we do with them. </p>

         <h1>Part 2</h1>
         <p class="funParagraph">&#182; In the previous post we talked about beer ingredients 
            and gave a little background into what where 
            they come from and what role they play in the creation 
            of beer. Now let's get to brewing. </p>

            <h2>
               Mashing
            </h2>
            <link href="mash">
            <img class="picRight" id="lightMalt" src="html-me-something\pilsnermalt.jpg" alt="Picture of light malt">
            <p>&#182;What do you do with all of your grains once you get them together? 
               Well first you will want to make sure the husks are cracked. If 
               you are shopping at your local homebrew shop they should be happy 
               to take care of this for you for a little extra charge, and some 
               give you access to their milling machine so you can do it yourself. 
               Or if you’d like, you can get your own mill. Milling the grain to 
               crack the husk is important because we need to expose the starches 
               inside to hot water and extract them. 

               &#182;This process is called mashing. The mash will take place between 
               140-165f. The lower range between 140-149f (145-149 being optimal) 
               will produce more fermentable sugars, giving the beer a lighter 
               body and higher abv. The higher range of 150-165(154-156 being 
               optimal) will yield less fermentable sugars and create a more 
               full bodied beer with some residual sweetness. </p>

            <h2>
               Hop and boil
            </h2>
            <link href="boil">
            <img class="picLeft" id="hopPellet" src="html-me-something\pellethops.jpg" alt="Image of pellet hops">
            <p>&#182;After mashing you will collect the sweet liquid that has been created, 
               we call this liquid wort. It is at this point you will want to boil 
               your wort and add your hops.

               &#182;Beyond their preservative powers, hops are a key component of beer because 
               of the taste they add. Hops help balance the sweetness of the beer by adding 
               bitterness, but they also can add other flavors and aromas. In certain beer 
               styles hops are the star of the show and malts take a back seat, a common 
               example being any variety of IPA. There are tons of hop varieties in 
               existence and more being cultivated every year. Like your malts and 
               grains the types of hops and amounts you use will be determined by the 
               beer style that you want to create, and the flavors and smells 
               you want to achieve. 

               There are several stages in which you can introduce your hops; the bittering 
               stage, the taste stage, the aroma stage, whirlpool, dry hop, and first wort. 
               The purpose of the bittering stage is just as it sounds, to add bitterness. 
               This is done when there is 30 minutes or more of boil time left in your wort. 
               The taste and the aroma stage will occur when there are 10 and 5 minutes 
               respectively left in your boil time. 

               Whirlpooling hops helps extract flavor without bitterness. This technique 
               has been highly popularized as Juicy and Hazy IPA have begun to dominate 
               the craft beer landscape. We’ll have to explore the science of why less 
               bitterness is extracted at a later date. </p>

            <h2>
               Ferment
            </h2>
            <link href="ferment">
            <img class="picRight" id="ferment" src="html-me-something\fermenters.jpg" alt="Fermentation vessel">
            <p>
               &#182;Now that you have extracted your wort, boiled it, and introduced your hops, 
               it's time to cool it down. Chilling your wort as quickly as possible will 
               be important. The two most common methods for home brewers are immersion 
               chillers and ice baths. Once your wort is chilled to around 68-72f it is 
               time to transfer your wort to a fermentation vessel. It is here where you 
               will introduce your yeast (you can’t go wrong following the manufacturer's 
               instructions for your yeast) and the magic of wort turning into beer will begin.

               Before we close out it is important to remind you that sanitation is very 
               important when it comes to brewing, as a brewer you will spend the bulk of 
               your time cleaning and setting up. But no place in your process is sanitation 
               more crucial than after the boil, everything needs to be cleaned and sanitized 
               that touches the beer once it is done boiling. Every tube, tool, vessel, and 
               utinzel. There is no worse feeling than spending 5 plus hours to find that your 
               beer has spoiled or soured.
